# supervised-machine-learning-challenge

This challenge shows understanding of supervised machine learning models. Specifically, the two that are utilized are the Logisitic Regression Model and the Random Forest Classifier Model. These two models are both run in the Jupyter Notebook, which pulls in data regarding loan application approval. The models are fitted with the data and are scored. Although the values produced are very similar, the Logistic Regression Model performed ever so slightly better.
